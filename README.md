# Mern Stack Blog App

#### This app is a simple blogging application that allows users to create, view, and edit blog posts. It is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, which is a popular choice for building web applications due to its versatility and ease of use.

 #### The application consists of a Node.js server that interacts with a MongoDB database to handle CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for blog posts. The front-end is built using React, which allows for a fast and responsive user interface. The application also uses Express.js as a web framework to provide a robust and scalable back-end. 

#### With this application, users can create new blog posts, edit existing posts, and view a list of all posts on the home page scrolling infinitely. The application also includes user authentication functionality, which ensures that only authenticated users can create or edit blog posts.
#### In case user wants to authenticate using google or facebook , we've added Oauth for that usecase and handling sessions which is also persisted to the database.
